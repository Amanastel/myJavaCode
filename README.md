# Core-JAVA Projects 🚀✨

This repository contains three projects developed in Core Java to solve basic problem statements. The projects focus on different aspects of Core Java, including console printing, multiple-choice questions, and simple interactive problems.

## Project 1: Console Printing

🖨️💬 This project demonstrates the basic functionality of console printing in Core Java. It provides examples and explanations of various methods and techniques for printing output to the console. You can explore the project to understand different ways of printing messages and formatting the output in the console.

## Project 2: Multiple Choice Questions

❓📝 The second project in this repository is a collection of multiple-choice questions related to Core Java. These questions cover various topics such as data types, control statements, object-oriented programming, exception handling, and more. Each question is accompanied by multiple options, and you can test your knowledge by selecting the correct answer.

## Project 3: Simple Interactive Problems

🔨🎮 In this project, you will find a set of basic interactive problems that can be solved using Core Java concepts. These problems are designed to help you practice your programming skills and reinforce your understanding of fundamental concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data structures. You can run the code provided in each problem and interact with it to see the expected output.

# Spring Projects ✨

This repository contains a collection of Spring projects that demonstrate different approaches to building applications using the Spring framework. The projects showcase both annotation-based and XML-based configurations, providing a comprehensive overview of Spring's flexibility and power.

## Projects 📂

1. **Project 1: Annotation-Based Approach 🚀**
   - This project showcases the usage of annotations for configuring Spring beans, dependency injection, and other Spring features.
